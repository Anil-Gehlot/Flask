# Flask Learning Repository

Welcome to my Flask learning repository! In this repository, I am documenting my journey as I learn Flask using the official documentation and various other sources. I will be uploading code examples and projects that I create while learning Flask.

## About Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight and powerful micro web framework for Python. It is widely used for developing web applications and APIs. Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Flask, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Official Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
- [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

Clone this repository to your local machine to explore the code examples and projects I've created while learning Flask.

## Code Examples

I have organized the code examples into directories, each demonstrating a specific concept or feature of Flask. You can find the code for each example in its respective directory:

- [Example 1: Hello World](example1_hello_world/)
- [Example 2: Routing](example2_routing/)
- [Example 3: Templates](example3_templates/)

Feel free to explore these examples to see how Flask works and experiment with the code.

## Projects

In addition to code examples, I will also be working on a Flask projects to apply what I've learned. You can find that project by clicking the following link.

- [Randon Database Generator ](projects/project1_todo_list/)


## Happy Learning

I hope you find this repository helpful in your journey to learn Flask. Happy coding and learning with Flask!
